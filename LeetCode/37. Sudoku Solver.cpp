/* 
    Time Complexity:
    ------------------------------------------------------- 
        We are trying to fill every empty cell with a number.
        Each cell has 9 choices.

        O(9^numEmplyCells)

        Depth of recursion:
            1. In the worst case, there are 81 empty cells.
            2. So the naive upper bound is: O(9^81) (Total 81 Cells) which is astronomically large.

        But in practice:
            1. Constraints (isPossible) prune most invalid paths early.
            2. The search space is drastically reduced.
            3. On standard Sudoku boards, the solver runs very efficiently.

        ðŸ‘‰ So the theoretical worst case: O(9^81)
        ðŸ‘‰ The practical case (with pruning): solvable within milliseconds.

    Space Complexity:
    -----------------------------------------------------
        O(1) Because we didn't use any extra memory.
